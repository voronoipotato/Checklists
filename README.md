# Checklists
## About; How to use
Some checklists to use for life. All the _rules_ detailed are merely guidelines, adopt them as is useful.To use a checklist, check any of the items that apply if any, add a timestamp, Save as; and save it in your personal notes with a name that is related to what your checklist is about. This will leave the original checklist unchanged. If you do not add a timestamp to a particular checklist then the checklist does not count. To properly go through checklist with a group it is most effective to read it aloud and have every person verbally agree to it, since agreeing to any item in the checklist implies accountability even if someone else did the work. There are two major kinds of checklists and in this framework you must specify if a checklist is observational or instructional. An observational checklist is one where the steps are to observe the present state aligns with the desired state. An instructional checklist is one where the steps are actions the checklist creator needs to enact. Observational checklists are like pre-flight checklists, and instructional checklists are like ikea assembly instructions. Observational checklists best fit for tasks you know how to do well and to prevent mistakes of routine. Instructional checklists best fit tasks that you are taking on the first time or ones you rarely do. 

If you cannot check an item in the worklist then it is your responsibility to communicate to the person who originally did the work so that they can resolve it. This may trigger a root cause analysis if one is warranted. GPG is included in git-bash by default. Use GPG to sign completed checklists, especially those with unchecked items. There may be times when you don't want or need to check all items in a checklist, however using a GPG signature allows you to communicate that you have accepted that risk.
